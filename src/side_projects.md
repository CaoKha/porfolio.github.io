Fascinating by finite machine methodology learned on TI-RSLK from Texas Instrument,
I implemented it on my own robot at home but replacing the MSP432 microcontroller by arduino.
The robot made decisions after each readings from luminosity sensor and infrared sensor.

Our robot need a front plate in order to attack the opponent. My task is to print the front plate of the robot. The other parts are carried out by my teammate.
At the beginning, I found that Catia V5 is expensive to buy and my license in school has just ended.
I searched on the Internet for a new open source software and I found Blender.
Luckily, Blender 2.8 just went out and it is amazing and very easy to use.

## 3. Testing

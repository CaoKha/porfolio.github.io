### Description:

This project is my first professional project in ReactJS without using any meta frameworks such as NextJS or NestJS.
All the work in the front-end is almost 100% done by me. The v1.0 is done within 1 day. The v1.1, a refactor of v1.0 is also done in 1 day. 
There are also some pull requests from other collaborators 
which are all well verified by me before merging into the code source.
